Learn Lithuanian visually
In this app I am going to provide a visual dictionary of Lithuanian words for the people who want to improve Lithuanian and the lithuanian people who want to get better in English. 
I am using mostly Kotlin as a programming language.
The architecture pattern of this App is MVVM. 
I have used kotlin concepts like data classes, Kotlin Coruotines in it.
The design patterns are used till now are Singleton Pattern, Adapter Pattern.

Functionalities :- 
1) Its has voice support to listen how the native speaker says the word in English 
2) It has support to add difficult word in flash-card Homework, where you can remove the word when you feel xomfortable with it
3) It will have Gamifaction ability to support to make usage of App, more friendly and fun. 
4) Currently working on building a data set in Python for training the model in Tensorflow so an ability to detect how much correct Lithuanian the user has learnt through Machine learning. 


Databases :- Room database library will be used to store the data localally.
